If your team is invited to World Festival or an International Open, you will have the opportunity to decorate your own pit space. The space varies from event to event. World Festival gives you 10 ft X 10ft pits.  Razorback gives you 6 ft X 5 ft pits. Be sure to check on the size and what is or is not allowed.

Some pits are incredibly fancy. Others are more simple. There is also nothing wrong with keeping your pit simple. A table cloth and displaying your poster boards can be just as effective. There is no contest for the best decorated or most expensive pit. Decorate your pit as your budget allows. Often you can get very creative even on a small budget.
