Many teams have to deal with a team member who is extraordinarily shy and freezes up when an adult talks to them. What should a team do and how should they plan for it?
 
 The following article incorporates ideas posted on the Facebook Group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FLLShareandLearn/">FLL: Share & Learn </a>.
 
 **Inform the Judge Advisor:**
 
Contact the Tournament Director and Judge Advisor ahead of time and let them know the situation. If jduges are informed ahead of time, they will be understanding of the student.

**Allow the student to read his/her part:**

Allow the student to have a written copy of his/her lines so that he/she can read them or refer to them if stuck.
  
**Have the other students support the shy student:**

Have the other students help the student who is shy during the presentation. Have a team member perhaps rephrase the question from the adult so it feels like the question is coming from a friend (rather than an adult).

**Give the student a non-speaking role:**

Every student does not have to speak, although every student must be involved in some way during the presentations. Find a role that the student is comfortable with.

**Speak through something else:**

Have the student speak through something else (like a puppet) or wear a costume that prevents eye contact with the adults (like a tree). This might help them be more comfortable.

**Help get the student comfortable:**

Practice with the student to help them feel prepared. Help him/her by providing sample questions. Sometimes a fidget toy in the pocket helps.
