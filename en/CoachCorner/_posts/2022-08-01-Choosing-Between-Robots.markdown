Your team has designed two different robots. How do we choose between them?

1. Test your robot to see which one is built better. Run the missions ten times. Which robot is more reliable? Keep in mind that reliability is a combination of physical and code attributes.

2. Do specific tests on the robot - 90 degree turns, moving straight, etc. Which one performs better with the same code?

3. Look at the rubric. There are places where students need to explain the robot code, attachments, and sensor functionality. Which robot would be more interesting to talk about in judging?

4. Note that you are allowed to take more than one robot to the contest. You can use a different robot in each of the three robot matches. You can take two robots into judging and explain both. One drawback would be having to spend time explaining two robot designs and two strategies in your 5-minute session.

5. Regardless of what you choose, document the two robots and how you decided which to use when. Share that with judges. Refer to the <a href=https://flltutorials.com/en/Worksheets.html">Robot Design Engineering Notebook Worksheets</a> for sample testing you could do on your robots and how to document the tests.
