As your team progresses through the season, you might find that they are running out of parts. It is common to need parts beyond the FIRST LEGO League or LEGO Education EV3 or SPIKE Prime sets. In FIRST LEGO League, all LEGO-branded parts are permitted, with a few exceptions (e.g. Power Functions and wind-up are not allowed, Sound sensors and Infrared sensors are not allowed, etc). Be sure you read the current year's Robot Game Rulebook for details as what is and is not allowed may change from year-to-year.

### How do I order sets, motors and sensors?

To order complete sets, sensors and motors, you can visit <a href="http://www.lego.com">LEGO</a> or <a href="http://www.legoeducation.com">LEGO Education</a>.


### How do I know what the part is called?

To order a specific part, you will need to know the LEGO part number. Some LEGO elements have their number printed on them. For most, you will need to look up the part number on the inventory list for the set it came from.  For example, the Education Edition of the EV3 Core Set is #45544.  The SPIKE Prime Set is #45678. If you use a site such as <a href="https://brickset.com/">Brickset</a>, you can look up what elements are in the set.  For example, type in "45544" in the Search bar on BrickSet. Then, pick "Parts". It will show you the name, part number, and all the other sets the piece comes in.


### Where can I buy specific parts from?

Once you know the name and part number, you can order that specific part from stores on Bricklink and Brickowl by entering the element number in the search bar.  If you cannot find the element number, type the name and it will pull up all closely related elements.

Tips: (Special thank you to Catherine Sarisky for several of the tips below.)
- When you purchase from Bricklink or Brickowl sites, make sure you pick a store with good reviews and lots of purchases. If you want to receive your items faster, pick someone local. You can purchase both new and used parts. Make sure that the vendor ships to your country. Sellers care about their reviews and generally sell what they list, check components, etc, and are happy to fix any errors in the shipment.
- When you purchase from LEGO Pick A Brick, please be aware that parts may take several weeks to arrive. This could be an issue for a team on a schedule.
- When using eBay look for high rankings, read product descriptions, and look carefully at photos. Prices are not always lower and quality or item might not be exactly what the image shows. Sometimes listings that say "complete" are not complete. Electronics may or may not be tested.
- Goodwill sales are as is. You might get a good deal or you may not. Nothing is tested and electronics might be broken.
