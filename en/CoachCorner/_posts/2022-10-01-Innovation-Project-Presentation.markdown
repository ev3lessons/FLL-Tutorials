Presenting your Innovation Project in front of judges is an important part of the process. Here are some tips to help your team.

1. Stay under the 5-minute time limit including setup time.

2. Even if you pick a creative theme for your presentation, you still need to share the information needed to fill in the rubric. Do not get caught up in the creative format and forget to share all the amazing content you have.

3. The best presentations include everything required in the rubric within the 5-minute time limit. Do not wait for Q&A to share critical information. Teams often find it challenging to cut their presentation down to 5-minutes, but this is an important step.

4. If you pick a creative theme, pick something that is common knowledge or something that could be easily understood no matter what your culture/background so that your judges do not have to work hard: Star Wars? Shark Tank? Little Red Riding Hood? Newscast?

5. Simple props and costumes can help viewers understand the skit and characters better and make it more engaging. You do not have to spend a lot of money. Get creative with the resources you have. Create name tags, use hats, or borrow some props.

6. Prototypes and visuals can help your judges understand the work and give them something to focus on. Most events do not let teams leave anything with judges. Therefore, make sure that you share these visuals with your judges during the presentation and Q&A. Also note that prototypes/diagrams are included in the rubric and can earn your team points.

7. Make sure that everyone is involved in the presentation. If some students are not comfortable presenting, think about what roles they can play or how you can help them become more comfortable.

8. Support your teammates and respectfully help them out if they forget their lines or make a mistake.

9. Memorize your lines and make eye contact with each other and the judges. Ideally, you will not memorize the exact wording, but the general information you want to communicate in your line. If you need some ways to remember your lines, Condense your lines into a bulleted list to help you remember. (Watch <a href=https://youtu.be/d812a7qG9Kw">this video </a> for tips on how to practice.

10. Practice your presentation many times and practice Q&A. Ask coaches and parents to act as judges and ask you questions about your project. Make sure that everyone on the team understands the project and can answer questions. Questions can be made up using the rubrics.

11. Some regions may require/allow slides along with your presentation. Keep in mind that most regions do not provide computers/projectors/screens. If you do choose to use slides, make sure that they are kept uncluttered and readable.

12. Do not be afraid to go up close to the judges. They cannot see poster boards, images or prototypes that are far away.

13. Many teams keep a Research Project Journal. In this journal they record their ideas, interviews, background research and progress each week. You can show the judges this journal and even use it to answer questions.

Here are some sample presentations for your inspiration. While they are from prior seasons where the rubric may have been different, they give you some idea of the possibilities.
