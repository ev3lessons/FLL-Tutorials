Here are some tips for organizing your robotics space.

 The following article takes ideas and discussions shared from the Facebook Group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FLLShareandLearn/">FLL: Share & Learn </a>.

1. Sorting your LEGO brick by element type (or group of elements) can be helpful. This way, students on the team can go pick the parts they need. At the end of the day, leave 10 mins for students to sort their unused elements back into the bins. Students might build at an empty table or even on the floor.

2. A "do not take apart" area is very important to have in order to prevent another team member from accidentally taking apart something that needs to be saved. Also remember to take photographs of progress/versions before taking them apart to add to an engineering journal. A "please take apart" bin can be helpful as well for place builds that may be taken apart and sorted.

3. Have a table and one or more computers/devices for students to use to program their robot and to do research. Make sure that students can easily charge their robots at the end of the day.

4. Have a white board/brainstorming area for students to take notes. If you do not have a board, you can use giant post-it papers and stick them on the wall too. Post these brainstorming ideas and a team calendar on the wall.

5. A reminder of the Core Values is useful to have. Having Core Values posters and a blank poster of some kind where students can write down an example of core values will help them remember specifics for judging later in the season.

6. Keep your FIRST LEGO League table and mission models clutter free and dust free. When not using the table, consider covering it up with a bedsheet or similar. You can also take off the mission models easily and put them away if you need to.
