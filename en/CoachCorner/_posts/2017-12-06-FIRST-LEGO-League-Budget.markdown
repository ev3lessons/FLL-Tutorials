When starting a FIRST LEGO League team, it is important to keep costs in mind. This is especially true if you are a school-based team and need to apply for grant money ahead of time. Here is a typical budget. The amounts are listed in US Dollars and based on expenses in the United States. There might be variation in other countries. It is good to check with your local organizer to see how much registration and equipment costs in your country.
