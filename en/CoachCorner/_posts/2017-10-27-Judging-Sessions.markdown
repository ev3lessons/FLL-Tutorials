It is helpful to have a good understanding of what is expected in judging sessions ahead of time. Please note that there is variation between regions in judging. Always contact the organizers in your region.

Be sure to check with your local tournament director for what is required in your region.

### Robot Design Judging

Teams are given five minutes for their Robot Design Explanation. Even though the word explanation is used, teams are expected to have a rehearsed presentation. Bring your robot, your attachment and code. The rubric is your guide for what to present to judges. Be prepared to show your programming. Either bring a printout or share your code on a laptop. Many regions do not allow teams to leave something behind with the judges. If you want the judges to see something, show them during your presentation or during Q&A. If you make a poster/tri-fold, make sure that judges can read the contents. Bring the board closer.
<br>
<br>
 <b>Q&A:</b> Judges have 5 minutes to ask you questions. Questions will be based on the rubric categories.
 <br>
 <br>
 Tips for preparing:<br>
  1) Know the key highlights of your robot and code <br>
  2) Be able to answer questions about the robot design, strategy & programming<br>
  3) Make sure all team member have some understanding of the robot and code<br>

### Innovation Project Judging

You will get 5 minutes including set-up to present your project. The timing starts as soon as you enter the room, so keep your set-up simple. There is no guarantee that there will be electric plugs or projectors. Doing a live presentation is also a requirement, so simply having a judge watch a video for the entire 5 minutes will not work. If you do want to incorporate some technology, be sure you understand that the set-up time is part of your team’s 5 minute presentation time. Adults will not be allowed to help set up. Make sure that you cover everything in the rubric. You can be as creative as you want to in the presentation. However, make sure that you still cover all the necessary content.

<b>Q&A:</b> Judges will have 5 minutes to ask you questions. These can be questions about how you did the research project, your problem, and your solution. Questions will be based on the rubrics. If they missed any information during the presentation, this is a chance for them to clarify.

Tips for preparing:<br>
 1) Memorize your skit/presentation as much as possible<br>
 2) Minimize time spent in setup<br>
 3) Try to cover all aspects of the rubric in your 5 minute presentation. Do not wait till Q&A to present key contents.

### Core Values Judging

Core Values is judged all through the 30-minute judging slot. Be sure to call about aspects of Core Values in your Team Welcome, Robot Design and Innovation Project judging.

<b>Q&A:</b> During the Core Values Reflection, judges will have 3 minutes to ask you questions. These questions will be based on the Core Values Rubric. Be sure that all your team members can give multiple examples of how you used the Core Values this season.

Tips for preparing: <br>
 1) Wear team t-shirts/hats or something else that identifies you as a team<br>
 2) Know the FIRST LEGO League Core Values<br>
 3) Be respectful of your team members throughout the competition. Your behavior in the pit, the robot game table, and all judging sessions matter when it comes to Core Values.
