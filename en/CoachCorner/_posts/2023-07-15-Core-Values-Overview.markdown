FIRST LEGO League Challenge consists of four categories (Core Values, Innovation Project, Robot Design, and Robot Game) and a team must do well in all four categories to advance to the next tournament. This post focuses on Core Values.

**Why Core Values?**

To understand the importance of Core Values, it’s important to understand their origin in FIRST. Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers created FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) to celebrate science and technology through robot competitions.

However, it is competition with an important caveat:

“Competition for the sake not of destroying one another, but for the sake of bettering and improving both competitors as a result of the competition.”
-- Woodie Flowers

Flowers believed that the robot competitions should foster fierce rivalry but also nurture respect, appreciation, and cooperation among competitors.The goal is for all participants to succeed in terms of knowledge gained, connections, and community.

To that end, Flowers coined the term “Gracious Professionalism” which is central to FIRST.

“With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process…No chest thumping tough talk, but no sticky-sweet platitudes either.
Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended…One can add to society and enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity.”
–Woodie Flowers

Flowers’ vision is further embodied in another term integral to FIRST, Coopertition® which means “displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition.”
Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition® are the ethos of FIRST and are expressed in the following Core Values:

**FIRST Core Values:**

    Discovery: We explore new skills and ideas.
    Innovation: We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.
    Impact:  We apply what we learn to improve our world.
    Inclusion: We respect each other and embrace our differences.
    Teamwork: We are stronger when we work together.
    Fun: We enjoy and celebrate what we do!

**My Take on Core Values:**

The Core Values are the special sauce of the FIRST program and this is the part of FIRST where the coach’s role is vital. Through the coach’s guidance, the kids will learn important life skills that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.

It’s important to recognize that learning to implement the Core Values is a process because an 8-year-old’s ability to embrace the Core Values is not the same as that of a 14-year-old. Likewise, some kids, no matter the age, may need more guidance on the Core Values, but I promise you that the hard work is worth it. One of my greatest joys as a coach was to watch the growth the kids made over the years in this area.

And remember, the best way to teach the Core Values is by example. The kids are always watching and learning from you (to that end, don’t be afraid to point it out and apologize when you make a mistake).

Lastly, no matter how prepared you are, something will always,100% guaranteed, go wrong at a tournament. Every single time. Learn to embrace those experiences because they are huge growth opportunities. I think my teams learned more about Core Values in those times of “crisis” than they did at any other time during the season.

**How to Incorporate the Core Values:**

The judges will complete the Core Values rubric after the team’s judging session. There is no right or wrong way to implement the Core Values; the following are just some examples of how your team can address each category on the Core Values rubric:

**Discovery–The team explored new skills and ideas**

Have each team member pick a new skill that they want to learn that season. Remember, the skill does not have to be robot related, it can be related to the project and/or core values. The kids should document the skill they learned and how they learned it.

**Innovation–The team used creativity and persistence to solve problems**

Your team will be employing this core value all season, whether it’s during the robot game, building a prototype for their project, trying to get an expert to respond to their inquiries, or coming to an agreement on how to approach an idea. It’s important that the kids document this throughout the season. What problems did they encounter? How did they resolve the issues? What worked and what didn’t? What did they do differently the next time? What did they learn? Your team should be prepared to discuss this with the judges during the judging session.

**Impact–The Team applied what they learned to improve their world**

One way your team will impact its community is through its innovation project because the team is improving the world by creating a solution to a real-world problem. Your team may also want to think about how it can impact the FIRST community, its neighborhood community, and even the international community (some activities my teams have done in the past are: write letters to nursing home residents, park clean-ups, host workshops for younger kids, fundraisers, host webinars, meet with other FIRST LEGO League teams). It’s important that the kids decide what activities they will do so that they take ownership of them.

**Inclusion–The team demonstrated respect and embraced their differences**

This Core Value is often more difficult for younger teams and it may take a concerted effort on your part to help the team foster this Core Value. During the early years with a team, I did things such as use a “talking stick” to encourage listening and discourage interrupting. I also had the kids complete team-building challenges and recorded them doing the tasks. It was helpful to be able to play back the videos for the kids and point out areas of success and areas for improvement. One year I banned the use of the word “no” for the entire season. We also talked a lot about how our differences make us stronger as a team because we all have different skill sets.

**Teamwork–The team clearly showed they had worked as a team throughout the journey**

One way I encouraged the kids to work together is by talking about what it means to be a good team member and the value of being on a team. I also placed the kids in situations where they had to learn to work together. For instance, one year I took them to downtown Seattle and told them they had to figure out how to get home without any help from me (of course, I followed along at a safe distance). Also, remember how something always goes wrong at a tournament? Those are excellent opportunities to build team skills. It’s important to point out all of the important skills the kids used to get past the “crisis” as a team (as well as point out areas for improvement).

**Fun–The team clearly had fun and celebrated what they have achieved**

This is so important but I think it’s sometimes overlooked because so much work needs to get done in order to properly prepare for a tournament. Consider starting each meeting with a game (Pictionary, Charades, chair races) and doing fun activities together outside of the meeting times (going for ice cream, escape rooms, games in the park). I also encourage you to take lots of breaks during the meetings and just let the kids goof-off.

**How to Tell the Judges about Your Team’s Core Values:**

There is time reserved during the 30-minute judging session for the judges to ask your team about its Core Values. The time varies, but generally is 3 minutes. I recommend that your team is prepared to give examples of its Core Values for each category on the Core Values rubric, as well as bring a poster that highlights its Core Values. Remember, the team will also be judged on its Core Values during the project and robot design portion of the judging session (i.e., Innovation is a Core Value and it can be demonstrated through the team’s project prototype; Inclusion is a Core Value and whether the kids demonstrate respect for each other will be evident in how they treat each other during the judging session)

The Robot Game referees will also have an opportunity to score the team for its Core Values during the Robot Game.

Thank you for coaching!
