- <a href="/translations/en-us/CoreValues/FLLChickenInstructions.jpg">FLLChicken Build instructions</a>
- <a href="/translations/en-us/Worksheets/FLLChickenHistory.png">FLLChicken History</a>


<b>Setup:</b>
- Build one complete FLLChicken and leave the rest in pieces
- A divider (trifold or similar) to block the view.


<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

Decide as a team who will give instructions. This student will have the complete chicken model and will give verbal instructions to the rest of the team to create a duplicate chicken with the loose elements. The student giving instructions may not look at what the rest of the team is doing. The team has 5 minutes to complete their build. Compare your chickens at the end of 5 minutes.
