<b>Objectives:</b>
- Valuing each team member

<b>Materials:</b>
- None

<b>Setup:</b>
N/A.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Sit in a circle on chairs or on the floor. Go around the room and say one compliment to another person on the team - (be as specific as possible). Be sure that everyone has received a compliment

<b>Notes:</b>
This activity works best if you have begun your season and the students have had a chance to work together. It also works best at the end of a team meeting rather than the beginning.

How does it feel to receive a compliment? If you do not know who is going to compliment you that day, does it impact how you behave during the meeting? Did you look for something positive to compliment during the meeting?
