This is a modular base robot built with elements in one SPIKE Prime Core Set (45678) plus parts from the expansion set (45681). A sample universal attachment design is available as part of the instructions. Note that this robot is designed for more experienced teams/users to learn more advanced building and programming skills. It will require some wire management skills as well. It also features color sensors that can act as touch sensors.
