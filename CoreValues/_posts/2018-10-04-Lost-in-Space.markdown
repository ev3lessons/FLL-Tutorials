<!--more-->

<b>Objectives:</b>
- Cooperation
- Using limited resources

<b>Materials:</b>
- Gerhard from INTO ORBIT
- A paper clip, some string/yarn, a paper bag, a ring/bracelet, 
- Tape

<b>Setup:</b>
- Using tape mark a line that the team may not cross
- Place the LEGO Gerhard at least 6 feet away from this line
- On the line, place a random collection of objects such as some string, a paperclip, bag, clothespin, pen, stick, ruler, etc.


<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

Gerhard is lost in space and you must rescue him. You and your crewmates must stay behind the line at all times. You may pick any 3 items at a time to help you rescue Gerhard. One problem - your communications systems are down. You can't speak to each other. Work together to rescue Gerhard within 5 mins. You may pick three items from the pile to use each attempt.

<b>Notes:</b>
Did the team follow the rules? How did the team communicate without words?
