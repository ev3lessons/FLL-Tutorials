<!--more-->

<b>Objectives:</b>
- Giving everyone a trurn
- Following instructions

<b>Materials:</b>
- None

<b>Setup:</b>
- Team in a circle

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

Count out loud to x [number of team members] in order.  No talking, planning, nor hand gestures to signal order.

•    Different team member should start the counting at one. 
•    The next number CANNOT be called out by the team member to the left or right of the last to call out a number .
•    Every team member should call out a number by the end (so each should only say a number one time)
•    If two team members call out the same number, then you have to start back at 1


<b>Notes:</b>

Variation: After they accomplish it, have the team member face the opposite direction in the circle so that nobody can see each other.
