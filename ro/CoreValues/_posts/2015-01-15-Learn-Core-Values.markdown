**Objectives:**
- Learn the FIRST LEGO League Core Values

**Materials:**
- Each of the Core Values listed on a strip of paper
- Large paper/poster
- Markers/Crayons

**Fold all the Core Values in half so that the team cannot read them. Leave the paper and markers on a table.

**Instructions to Team:**
Pick one Core Value at random and illustrate it with anything that shows how your team exhibits this Core Value. You will have 5 minutes.

**Notes:**
In this version, the team does not get to choose their favorite Core Value. This is so that they will get familiar with all of them. Have the team present their poster at the end of five minutes.
