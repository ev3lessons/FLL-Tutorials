<b>Objectives:</b>
- Coming to a consensus
- Communicating with each other
- Learning to work together and coordinate

<b>Materials:</b>
Two 8’ 2x4s (or 2x6’s) for a team of 5
Ten 4-5’ lengths of rope (2 per team member)
Drill with 1” and 3/8” drill bits

<b>Setup:</b>
On strips of paper, write out differnt things/processes your team can act out. Fold them so that the team cannot read them when picking one. Place all of them in an envelope/box or spread of a table. Place the random collection of objects in a box.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Let’s go skiing together. Your team has one pair of skis Move across the room or driveway using only the skis.

<b>How to construct the skis:</b>
Starting at one end of each 2x4 (laid flat on the 4” side), mark 6”, 24”, 42”, 60” and 78”, each in the center of the 2x4. Make the same marks on the other 2x4.

At each mark, drill halfway (3/4”) with the 1” drill bit. Then, drilling in the center of each 1” diameter hole, drill through the 2x4 with the 3/8” drill bit.

Tie a knot at the end of each piece of rope and feed the other end through the 2x4, larger hole side first.

The knots will fit inside the 1” diameter portion of the hole, but not pull through the 3/8” hole.
Flip the skis over – each team member should stand with their rope at their feet.
