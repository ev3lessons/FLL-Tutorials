Team Building Activity: Bust the Balloon<br>
<!--more-->

<b>Objectives:</b>
Through this activity teams will learn the FIRST Core Values, while practicing innovation, persistence, and having fun!

<b>Materials:</b>
- Opaque balloons (if possible), a pen, & 8 small strips of paper


<b>Setup:</b>
- The Coach needs to write Gracious Professionalism, Coopertition, and each Core Value on small strips of paper.  Then, put one strip of paper into each balloon and blow up & tie the balloons.   If you blow up the balloons a lot, you will make it easier for them to pop.   



<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

Each team member should take a balloon.  One at a time, team members take turns popping the balloons, each using a different method of popping the balloon.  Be creative!  Once the balloon is popped, have each team member find and hold onto the strip of paper.
<br><br>
After all of the balloons have been popped, take turns reading aloud the strips of paper and discuss them as a team.
<br><br>
Notes: This could also be done to learn Robot Game Rules, Missions, etc.
