<b>Objectives:</b>
- Working together
- Coming up with creative solutions

<b>Materials:</b>
- Any bag
- Some string or any random collection of objects

<b>Setup:</b>
- Create a line on the floor far enough away that the students cannot reach the bag.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Your team is stranded on an island. You can see a bag of food and water floating nearby (but out of your reach). You can use the items you were given to help you reach. Your feet may not touch the shark infested waters between you and the bag.

<b>Notes:</b>
During the activity, listen to their conversation and decision making process. Did they come up with any unusual solutions that still followed the rules?
