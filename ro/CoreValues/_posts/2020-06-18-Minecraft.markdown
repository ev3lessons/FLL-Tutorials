<b>Setup:</b>
- Set up your own multiplayer, private Minecraft server. Follow instructions below:
- <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/"> Java Edition</a>
- <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/?fbclid=IwAR0HLjchnLOuu3gt3Fx8jNaKWxo_DEaX33-HwAr04-rq6--MBczZyFHMEos"> Bedrock Edition </a>

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

Join the server to play with each other. One student will have to host and setup <a href="https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/">port forwarding</a> on his or her router so that the rest of the team can access the server. You can talk to each other over Zoom or Discord to chat at the same time.

<b>Notes:</b>
Minecraft is a popular block building game. There are many publicly available Minecraft servers. Some are moderated and others are not. For a FIRST LEGO League team, we recommend that you set up a private one yourself so that your team and your invited guests know it will be a safe environment. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-minecraft-server/"> Article on Minecraft servers</a>
