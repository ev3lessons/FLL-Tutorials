<b>Objectives:</b>
- Learn to collaborate and coordiate actions

<b>Materials:</b>
- One hula hoop

<b>Setup:</b>
- Leave the hoop in the middle of the room

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Lift the hoop as high as possible.  Each team member may only place one figer on the hoop. If the hoop is dropped, you must start over. You have 2 minutes.

<b>Notes:</b>
Listen to see how they decide to compete the task and how they coordinate the movement.  Since some kids will be taller than others, and some will move faster than others, they have to cooperate.
