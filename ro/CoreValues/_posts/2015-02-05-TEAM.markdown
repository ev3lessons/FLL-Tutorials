<b>Objectives:</b>
- Getting to know teammates
- Respecting teammates
- Understanding different skills and contributions

<b>Materials:</b>
- Small pieces of paper (or sticky notes)
- Glue sticks (if you did not use sticky notes)
- 4 large sheets of paper

<b>Setup:</b>
- Leave materials on the table, Each student should be given around 2-4 sticky notes.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Write a compliment about someone else on your team. When you are done, spell out the word TEAM. Make sure everyone has a compliment - even coaches and mentors.

<b>Notes:</b>
This is a good activity for towards the end of the season, once students know each other. At the end, take turns reading the compliments out - read out at least one per person on the team.
