Team Building Activity: Acts of Kindness<br>
Author: Lucas from FRC 8027
<!--more-->

<b>Objectives:</b>
- The team will learn what fellow members appreciate about them. This will help them gain a more personal connection with fellow teammates.

<b>Materials:</b>
- None

<b>Setup:</b>
- The coach should randomly pair up students on the team
- Provide each student the contact information for their match (email, text, etc)

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

Each pair will let their partner know what they appreciate the most about them. They can email the message or send a text, etc.

<b>Notes:</b>
This activity can be completed even if there are new students on the team. If a pair of students have never interacted before, they can instead write about what they would like to know about their partner.
