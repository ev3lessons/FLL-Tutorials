<b>Objectives:</b>
- Coming up with a team identity
- Making a decision quickly

<b>Materials:</b>
- Large sheet of paper - Markers

<b>Setup:</b>
Provide teams with the materials

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
In the middle of the paper write one word that best describes your team. Decorate the rest of the page however you wish (with examples, quotes, colors, etc.). You have 5 minutes

<b>Notes:</b>
This activity is designed to help teams think about their team identity. At the end of 5 minutes, have the team present their poster and explain their choices. You might do this same activity twice in the season (once at the beginning and once at the end) to see if the team perceives itself differently.
