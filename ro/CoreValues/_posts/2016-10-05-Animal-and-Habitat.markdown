<b>Objectives:</b>
- Communicate with team members

<b>Materials:</b>
- Two piles of random pieces of LEGO at either end of a table or on the floor
- A poster board or divider so one pile is not visible from the other (you are also have the team simple turn the other way to work)

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Split into two teams. One team must build an animal. The second team must build a habitat for the animal. You will have 5 minutes

<b>Notes:</b>
This activity was designed for the Animal Allies season. How did they split into two teams? How did they pick what to build? How did the two teams communicate with each other? Were they successful in fitting the two parts together? Ask the team why they decided to make that animal and habitat.

In the above image, the team made a pig with pink LEGO brick, and a pig pen for the pig.
