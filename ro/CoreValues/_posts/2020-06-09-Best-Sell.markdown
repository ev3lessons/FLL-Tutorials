Team Building Activity: Best Sell<br>
Author: Eli from FRC 8027
<!--more-->

<b>Objectives:</b>
- The goal of this activity is to learn to present your ideas to others quickly and effectively. Students will have a chance to be creative. Students will also learn how to appropriately share feedback.

<b>Materials:</b>
- All that is needed is a way for each student to write down their ideas and a way for the students to vote on an idea.


<b>Setup:</b>
- None


<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

The goal is for the team to come up with the best idea and pitch to try to sell their product.
Each team member should pick a product or idea.
Create a short, yet effective pitch in 5mins for this product or idea.
Pitch the idea to the team. Listen to the feedback from the rest of the team.
After all the pitches are given everyone votes, for whatever they think was the best idea and the best pitch.


<b>Notes:</b>
 This activity can also be done in teams. Another variation is for each student to come up with a wacky invention idea, but has to trade with someone else on the team. This way, they will be creating a pitch for another studentâ€™s idea.
