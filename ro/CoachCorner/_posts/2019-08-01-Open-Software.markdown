This season, you can use any programming language you want in FIRST LEGO League.

## The Software Section of the Rules mentions the following:

"You can use any software that allows the Robot to move autonomously â€“ meaning it moves on its own. No form of remote control is allowed."

Please refer to this handy <a href=" https://bit.ly/2MtNnNr">spreadsheet</a> to compare compatible software choices. Please note that while you are allowed to use several programming languages, not all the languages will have equal support for FIRST LEGO League teams.
