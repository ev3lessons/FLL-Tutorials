Here is my summary of what I think is essential to coaching Core Values. There is information that may be specific to my region (Utah) as well as some information that may be specific to my team.

The FIRST LEGO League Core Values set FLL apart from many other competitions. They embody a set of skills that are essential for life and require attention throughout the season. You may hear “the innovation project and the robot game are what we do, the core values are how we do it.” Because of this, working on the Core Values shouldn't be entirely separated from the other parts of FLL. Coaches should aim to help the kids practice and improve their Core Values skills through all of their work. Coaches should also set a good example for the team by acting in accordance with the Core Values during meetings.

### FIRST LEGO League Core Values until 2017 (while these are no longer officially used, they still have value):

We are a team.<br>
We do the work to find solutions with guidance from our coaches and mentors.<br>
We know our coaches and mentors don't have all the answers; we learn together. <br>
We honor the spirit of friendly competition.<br>
What we discover is more important than what we win.<br>
We share our experiences with others<br>
We display Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® in everything we do.<br>
We have FUN!<br>

### Current Core Values:

We express the FIRST philosophies of Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition through our Core Values:

<b>Discovery:</b> We explore new skills and ideas. <br>
<b>Innovation:</b> We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.<br>
<b>Impact:</b> We apply what we learn to improve our world.<br>
<b>Inclusion:</b> We respect each other and embrace our differences.<br>
<b>Teamwork:</b> We are stronger when we work together.<br>
<b>Fun:</b>  We enjoy and celebrate what we do!

### Core Values Judging

Core Values judging is conducted as part of the 30-part judging session. Core Values judging has changed dramatically over the years. In the past, teams had to do a team activity, give a very short presentation, and have a Core Values poster board. These are no longer used. Core Values judges will be listening to the students during the entire 30mins. There are 3 minutes built into the schedule for a Core Values judge to ask questions. Gracious Professionalism is judged by your robot game referee. Additionally, tournament volunteers who observe a team exhibiting positive or negative Core Values throughout the day may relay that information to the judges.

Core Values are to be internalized and “lived” by a team, not practiced only in the judging room! This is one of the best elements of FLL, and it makes the atmosphere at tournaments a truly enjoyable place to be. Despite the fact that they are engaged in competition, the teams are looking for opportunities to help each other and share what they've learned.

### Have an Identity/Team Spirit:

Coaches should help foster this by encouraging team chants and silly “inside jokes” and whatever else arises naturally in the course of meetings. T-shirts, funny hats or other “costume” ideas, and silly titles can play into this as well. Coaches should follow the kids' lead while encouraging them to come up with things that encourage team identity and fun. For the event, it's nice to have a banner or flag or something similar to carry during the parade and decorate the table in the pits.

### Teaching Core Values Directly:

Once a week, the team should do a team building activity. Ideally, the activity should be recorded and immediately played back for the team so that they can critique their own performance. It is much more impactful for them to see directly how they are interacting than any feedback you can provide them. There are tons of team building activities online – they don't need to be fancy or require much in the way of materials.

### Teaching Core Values Indirectly (but kind of directly!):

All coaches should stay aware of how the team is interacting with one another as they work, and should be ready to help mediate any disagreement with an emphasis on the Core Values. Disagreements will come up in the Project or Robot Game work fairly often. It is by practicing the Core Values at meetings as they navigate the challenges of FLL that the team will really be able to internalize them. Expect slip ups! That's ok. The point is to continue learning and improving throughout the whole season.

### Core Values Deliverables:

The team does the work, the coach reminds them a million times to get it done. If the team has older / more mature members, you could assign some of these items to a team leader. Then the coach would only have to remind that team member and see if they need help with something.

Over the season:
- Learn the Core Values
- Practice Core Values while executing Project and Robot game
- Do specific Core Values activities and improve communication
- If possible, meet with / help / collaborate with another team or an Explore team
- Have examples to give your judges

Take to event:
- Core Values poster (optional)
- Team core values summary to leave with judges (if allowed)
- Giveaways to share with other teams­ (if allowed at your event)
- Team spirit / cheering items (Banners, shirts, pennants, etc.)
- Pit decorations (check what is allowed at your event)
- Banner / flag for the parade
