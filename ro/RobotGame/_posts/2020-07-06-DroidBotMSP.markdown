This is a modular base robot built largely with one SPIKE Prime Core Set (45678) plus one more large motor. You will need an extra color sensor, a ball wheel, and a frame from the Expansion to construct some of the modules. Attachments are easy to put on and take off. A sample attachment module is provided.

Design by Sanjay and Arvind Seshan
