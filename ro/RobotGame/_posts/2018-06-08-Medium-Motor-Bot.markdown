This is a compact robot design that uses 4 medium motors. It also has a 2 color sensors, 1 gyro sensor and 1 ultrasonic. Two of the motors have been positioned upwards to enable easy attachments. The robot features an outer wall for alignment on walls and mission models. The two color sensors are well positioned for aligning on lines.

Note: This robot is not the "best or perfect robot" for competition. It is provided here for learning purposes so that teams can try and build different models and learn some features from them. If you use it as a base for a competition, be sure to credit the source of the idea (and name the original designer) ÃŸin your Robot Design presentation and/or Engineering Journal.

To view the attached file, you will have to install LEGO Digital Designer (LDD), a software that is freely available for download on the Internet. No build instructions are provided at this time and LDD generates very poor-quality instructions. Use the "hide" tool in LDD to hide sections and build.
